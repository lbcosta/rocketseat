# Rocketseat - Bootcamp

## Motivation
In July 2019, I decided to take a Web Development course. I really wanted to learn how to develop all parts of a web application. From designing databases, API's and every other component on server side to designing and building a user interface on client side. Even on mobile. With that being said, I was looking for being a Fullstack Web Developer.

## Bootcamp

That's where Rocketseat enters in my life. I found them on a Youtube advertising offering a course that promised teaching everything one needed to develop a **React/Node** web application. Every concept of the frameworks, every auxiliary library for dealing with databases, logging, emails and so on.  I was enchanted by their content list and that made me enroll to the course without hesitating.

## This repository

The first version of this repository (made in July 2019) was created to keep the code I wrote for the lessons and challenges in the Bootcamp. But, as University internship projects started to take all my time, I decided to use the bootcamp as a guide to finish these projects. Consequently, all my skills learned were put into there and the repository was abandoned.

**In September 2019, I realized how important it was to share my experience with others**. So I decided to restart the Bootcamp, but now keeping track of all my progress and sharing it here and on Instagram. For this reason, I'll try to make this repository as readable as possible for anyone. With clear *README*s to each lesson.
